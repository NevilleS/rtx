*               MTE 241: RTOS Project (RTX)                 *
************************************************************/

========================SUMMARY==============================

This is a simple RTOS (real time OS) project submitted for credit at the University of Waterloo for MTE241.
The "OS" itself is actually just another implementation of user-space threads, and it runs a couple simplistic user
processes o demonstrate the task scheduler, messaging services, etc. It is written in C++ for compilation on UNIX
systems and uses the curses library for a simplistic UI.

================HOW TO COMPILE AND EXECUTE====================

The RTX can be compiled in a single command using the included Makefile.
The default target builds all three executables (RTX.out, KB.out, DSP.out).
Type "make" in the top-level directory and the three executables will be generated in the "bin" directory. The RTX
runs by executing RTX.out, and is terminated either by the CCI "t" command or by pressing Ctrl+C.
